				Mechanical Design Engineerat Vavni Inc. (4800 Patrick Henry D, Santa Clara, CA95054)
				Vavni is a design consulting firm where I have worked with various clients performing turnkey product development from concept ideation to manufacturing, and value engineering projects to provide cost savings on existing products. Areas include:
				Consumer Experience Design: Created a button feel test pad to propose solutions for a button failure on Avid Technologies‘ top of the line studio mixer. Studied button force profiles to pinpoint solution.
				Engineering Testing: Data acquisition using thermocouple setup. Analyzing data to compare plenum filter designs on a Cisco chassis. Final solution improved airflow up to 30% compared to existing build.
				Prototyping: Created mechanical design and prototyped automated deadbolt lock POC for Masterlock. System involved servo motor, Arduino microcontroller, Raspberry Pi and Android phone app.
				Key responsibilities include:
				<ul>
					<li>•Sketching and CAD modelling to aid concept creation and brainstorming sessions.</li>
					<li>•Creating 3D models and drawings for sheet metal, machine and plastic injection molded parts using SolidWorks and Creo. Experience with large master assembly models.</li>
					<li>•Standardized tolerance analysis methodology at Vavni to improve manufacturing yield using RSS and Worst Case analysis techniques.</li>
					<li>•Performing FEA simulation for stress, deflection and heat transfer.</li>
					<li>•Working with contract manufacturers to resolve DFM and DFA issues. Documentation during First Article inspection with senior engineers at factories. (DFX)</li>
					<li>•PCB/Flex mechanical modelling, component placing, designing keep outs, connector sourcing and integration. Daughter board assembly and connector mates.</li>
					<li>•PTC Windchill, Pro/Intralink, SolidWorks PDM/Explorer, and Agile PLM for product data and lifecycle management–including Bill of Materials (BOM)</li>
					<li>•Vendor management: Extensively assisting project manager during CM/OEM quoting process. Analyzing quotes, and creating comparison summaries for VP level staff. CMs have included Foxconn, and Flextronics.</li>
				</ul>
